Tic-Tac-Toe, an iconic game every dev has had a go at building, this is my own take on it using Swift and UIKit. I made this app early on in my coding journey and set it as a weekend challenge for myself.

Features  

- Customizable player colors: The launch screen allows each player to choose a color using a UIColorWell, which is then applied throughout the game UI.
- Turn-based gameplay: Each player takes turns marking the grid, with clear indicators showing whose turn it is.
- Win and tie detection: Functions check for winning conditions or a tie at the end of each move, updating the UI accordingly.
- Score keeping: Track the number of wins for each player, with the option to reset scores.
- Sound effects: Different sound effects for X and O bring the app to life, enhancing the user experience.
- Clean and minimal UI: A focus on simplicity and usability ensures a smooth gameplay experience. The UI also supports light and dark modes.
