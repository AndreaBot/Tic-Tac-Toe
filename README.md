# Tic-Tac-Toe

A clean-looking app to play Tic-Tac-Toe

Upon launching the app the players are able to set a custom colour for the X and O using a colour wheel.
Those colors get then passed on to the main game where the same colours are also used for various UI elements and events.

Extra functionalities include some buttons at the top of the screen to go back to the launch screen, start a new game and reset the score.
